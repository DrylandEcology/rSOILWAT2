#------ Mean monthly biomass values
# Spatial reference of biomass inputs (isBiomAsIf100Cover)
1   # 0, values as is (at given cover); 1, values as if cover was 100%

# --- Interpretation of biomass if isBiomAsIf100Cover is true (1)
# Input biomass values are independent of the input composition values.
# Input biomass per unit area (g / m2) for each vegetation type represent
# values as if that vegetation type covers 100% of the simulated surface.
# For example,
#   - inputs for forbs: fCover = 0.4, biomass = 300 g/m2
#   - inputs for grasses: fCover = 0.6, biomass = 450 g/m2
# Then, SOILWAT2 simulates a surface with vegetation of
#     fCover = 1 (= 0.4 + 0.6)
# and a
#     total biomass = 390 g / m2 (= 0.4 * 300 + 0.6 * 450)
# of which
#     forb biomass = 120 g / m2 (0.4 * 300)
# and
#     grass biomass = 270 g/m2 (= 0.6 * 450).

# --- Interpretation of biomass if `isBiomAsIf100Cover` is false (0)
# Input biomass represent values observed in the field.
# Input biomass per unit area (g / m2) for each vegetation type represent
# values at the provided vegetation type cover.
# For example,
#   - inputs for forbs: fCover = 0.4, biomass = 300 g/m2
#   - inputs for grasses: fCover = 0.6, biomass = 450 g/m2
# Then, SOILWAT2 simulates a surface with vegetation of
#     fCover = 1 (= 0.4 + 0.6)
# and a
#     total biomass = 750 g / m2 (= 300 + 450)
# of which
#     forb biomass = 300 g / m2
# and
#     grass biomass = 450 g/m2.


# Litter   - dead leafy material on the ground (g/m^2 ).
# Biomass  - living and dead/woody aboveground standing biomass (g/m^2).

# LAI_conv - monthly amount of biomass needed to produce LAI=1.0 (g/m^2).

-105.58	# longitude (degrees; W < 0; E > 0)
				# (currently not used by simulation, but useful for site documentation)
39.59		# latitude (degrees; N > 0; S < 0)
1000		# elevation (m a.s.l.)
0		# slope (degrees): no slope = 0, vertical surface = 90
NAN		# aspect = surface azimuth angle (degrees): S=0, E=-90, N=Â±180, W=90;
		# ignored if slope = 0 or aspect takes a missing value, i.e., NAN or 999

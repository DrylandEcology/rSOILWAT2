#------ Input file for site location, initialization, and
#       miscellaneous model parameters

# USER: The site location and the transpiration regions should
#       be adjusted for site-specific run conditions.

# USER: Most of the other values in this file are parameters that
#       describe various model processes and should be considered fixed.


#---- Soil water content initialization, minimum, and wet condition
-1.0		# swc_min : cm/cm if 0 - <1.0, -bars if >= 1.0.; if < 0. then estimate residual water content for each layer
15.0		# swc_init: cm/cm if < 1.0, -bars if >= 1.0.
15.0		# swc_wet : cm/cm if < 1.0, -bars if >= 1.0.

#---- Diffuse recharge and runoff/runon
0		# reset (1/0): do/don't reset soil water content for each year
1		# deepdrain (1/0): allow/disallow deep drainage (diffuse recharge)
1.0		# multiplier for PET (e.g., for climate change scenarios)
0.0		# proportion of ponded surface water removed as daily runoff (value ranges between 0 and 1; 0=no loss of surface water, 1=all ponded water lost via runoff)
0.0		# proportion of water that arrives at surface added as daily runon [from a hypothetical identical neighboring site] (value ranges between 0 and +inf; 0=no runon, >0: runon is occuring)

#---- Snow simulation
# based on the SWAT2K model by Neitsch et al. (2005)
# Current values are RMSE optimized based on 10 random SNOTEL sites for western US
0.61		# TminAccu2 = Avg. air temp below which ppt is snow ( C)
1.54		# TmaxCrit = Snow temperature at which snow melt starts ( C)
0.1		# lambdasnow = Relative contribution of avg. air temperature to todays snow temperture vs. yesterday's snow temperature (0-1)
0.0		# RmeltMin = Minimum snow melt rate on winter solstice (cm/day/C)
0.27		# RmeltMax = Maximum snow melt rate on summer solstice (cm/day/C)

#---- Hydraulic conductivity
0.02		# Parameter (cm / day) for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity,
		# previously called slow-drain coefficient; See Eqn 2.9 in Parton 1978.

#---- Evaporation
# These control the tangent function (tanfunc) which affects the amount of soil
# water extractable by bare-soil evaporation and transpiration.
45.		# rate shift (x value of inflection point).  lower value shifts curve
		# leftward, meaning less water lost to evap at a given swp.  effectively
		# shortens/extends high rate.
.1		# rate slope: lower value (eg .01) straightens S shape meaning more gradual
		# reduction effect; higher value (.5) makes abrupt transition
.25		# inflection point (y-value of inflection point)
0.5		# range: diff btw upper and lower rates at the limits

#---- Transpiration
# These control the tangent function (tanfunc) which affects the amount of soil
# water extractable by transpiration.
45.		# rate shift
.1		# rate shape
.5		# inflection point
1.1		# range

#---- Site location and topography
-105.58	# longitude (degrees; W < 0; E > 0)
				# (currently not used by simulation, but useful for site documentation)
39.59		# latitude (degrees; N > 0; S < 0)
1000		# elevation (m a.s.l.)
0				# slope (degrees): no slope = 0, vertical surface = 90
NAN			# aspect = surface azimuth angle (degrees): S=0, E=-90, N=Â±180, W=90;
				# ignored if slope = 0 or aspect takes a missing value, i.e., NAN or 999

#---- Soil temperature
# from Parton 1978, ch. 2.2.2 Temperature-profile Submodel
300.		# biomass limiter, 300 g/m^2 in Parton's equation for T1(avg daily temperature at the top of the soil)
15.		# constant for T1 equation (used if biomass <= biomass limiter), 15 in Parton's equation
-4.		# constant for T1 equation (used if biomass > biomass limiter), -4 in Parton's equation
600.		# constant for T1 equation (used if biomass > biomass limiter), 600 in Parton's equation
0.00070		# constant for cs (soil-thermal conductivity) equation, 0.00070 in Parton's equation
0.00030		# constant for cs equation, 0.00030 in Parton's equation
0.18		# constant for sh (specific heat capacity) equation, 0.18 in Parton's equation
4.15		# constant soil temperature (Celsius) at the lower boundary (max depth); approximate by mean annual air temperature of site
15.		# deltaX parameter for soil_temperature function, default is 15.  (distance between profile points in cm)  max depth (the next number) should be evenly divisible by this number
990.		# max depth for the soil_temperature function equation, default is 990.  this number should be evenly divisible by deltaX
1		# flag, 1 to calculate soil_temperature, 0 to not calculate soil_temperature

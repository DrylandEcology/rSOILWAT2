#------ Input file for the spatial and temporal domain

# A domain describes a set of related simulation runs

# USER: years must be consistent with `weathsetup.in`, `carbon.in`,
#       and (if used) `swcsetup.in`.
# NOTE: This file follows a key-value pair. That is, the value is only matched with the key
# eliminating the possibility of incorrect reads due to line dependencies.

nDimX     1                     # Number of grid cells along x dimension (used if "xy")

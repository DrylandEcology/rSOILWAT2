# rSOILWAT2
A R package for SOILWAT2.

## Considerations

We haven't really published the code yet nor prepared it for sharing (though
through our use of `github` made it openly accessible), it is actively and
gradually being developed by the Lauenroth lab and affiliates, and there is
no manual either - we cannot give you individual support in setting up and
running the model except if we agreed on a collaboration or similar agreement.

Not every part of the code has been extensively tested or is in a stable state.
Similarly, not every combination of model inputs and options has been evaluated
in depth and there is not guarantee for anything to work. The code comes with
no warranty and no guarantees, expressed or implied, as to suitability,
completeness, accuracy, and whatever other claim you would like to make.

There is no graphical user interface, help pages and available documentation
may be out of date, and you will need to write your own tools to analyze
outputs.

Note, the branch 'master' is deployable and is released with version numbers.

Please cite the package if you publish results based on simulations carried
out with our package, see `citation("rSOILWAT2")`, and we would like to hear
about your publication.

### Installation

`rSOILWAT2` will compile the c code of
[SOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2) -- see section on
binary version below for alternatives.
Your computer must be set up adequately, i.e.,

#### Minimal requirements include
  - on any platform:
    - the [`gcc`][] or [`clang`/`llvm`][] toolchains;
      ideally, `gcc >= v4.9` or `clang >= v3.3`
    - POSIX- [`make`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) or
      GNU-compliant [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    - [`git`][] to download the code
  - additionally, on Windows OS:
    - [`Rtools`](http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
      installed that match your R version.
  - on `macOS`:
    - `xcode` command line tools (run `xcode-select --install` on the command line)
    - having agreed to the `xcode` license (run `xcodebuild -license`)
    - or, alternatively, the full [`xcode`](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
      installation
  - optional:
    - a minimal `latex` installation (see below) and
      `pandoc` (`RStudio` comes bundled with `pandoc`)
      to generate package vignettes


#### Example instructions for a minimal `latex` installation
  * details on [`tinytex`](https://yihui.name/tinytex/)
  * install the R package `tinytex`
    ```{r}
    install.packages("tinytex")
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```

  * if you don't have write permission to `/usr/local/bin`,
    then appropriate symlinks are not generated;
    thus, locate the path to `tlmgr`, e.g.,
    with help of `tinytex::tinytex_root()`, and
    fix symlinks with escalated privileges
    ```{bash}
    sudo [path/to/]tlmgr path add
    ```


#### Install rSOILWAT2
  * Using the `remotes` R package
    ```{r}
    remotes::install_github("DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
    ```

  * On the command line
    ```{bash}
    git clone -b master --single-branch --recursive https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2.git rSOILWAT2
    R CMD INSTALL rSOILWAT2
    ```

<br>



### Binary package version
If you want a binary version of the 'rSOILWAT2' package (e.g., to distribute to
someone without development tools) for a platform to which you do not have
access, then you may consider using one of the cloud services (no endorsements):
- https://builder.r-hub.io offers different Linux, Windows, and `macOS` flavors
  as targets
- http://win-builder.r-project.org/ offers Windows OS as target

Alternatively, you may access the previous binary package version for
Windows OS from CI `appveyor` service if the build was successful and an
artifact was generated for the binary package (this would be named
'rSOILWAT2_X.Y.Z.zip' with version number X.Y.Z) at
- https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dschlaep/rSOILWAT2/build/artifacts
If the latest build should have failed, then you may want to check out the
'History' tab for binaries of older versions.
- After you downloaded the binary package, open R, and run
  ```{r}
  install.packages(pkgs = "path/to/downloaded/zipfile.zip", repos = NULL)
  ```

### For code contributors only

__Follow our guidelines__ as detailed [here](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/workflow_guidelines)

__Tests, documentation, and code__ form a trinity
- Code documentation
  * Read the [section 'Object documentation' in the book 'R packages' by Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html)
  * Use [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/formatting.html)
    to write inline code documentation
  * Update help pages and NAMESPACE with the command `devtools::document()`
  * Ideally, add examples to function documentation and check these examples
    with the command `devtools::run_examples()`
- Code tests
  * Read the [section 'Testing' in the book 'R packages' by Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)
  * Unit tests
    * Use [`testthat`](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) to add unit tests to the
      existing framework
    * Run unit tests locally with the command `devtools::test()`
    * These unit tests will also be run on the command-line with `R CMD check .`
      which you can run also with `devtools::check()`
    * The command-line check will be run on the continuous integration frameworks
      `travis` and `appveyor` when commits are pushed
    * Development/feature branches can only be merged into master if they pass
      all checks
  * Integration tests/checks: run a default example and look at some of the
      output (see also `?sw_exec`), e.g.,
      ```{r}
      path_demo <- system.file("extdata", "example1", package = "rSOILWAT2")
      x <- sw_exec(dir = path_demo, files.in = "files.in", quiet = TRUE)
      str(x)
      ```


  * __Run the following steps locally__
    in order to prepare a pull-request or commit that will be reviewed.
    Fix any problem and repeat as necessary.

    1. Make sure that the documentation is up-to-date with:
       ```{r}
       pkgbuild::compile_dll()
       devtools::document()
       ```

    1. Run and check the code from the examples and vignettes:
       ```{r}
       devtools::run_examples()
       ```
       Note: `devtools` v2.0.1 mixed up the logic for "dontrun" examples (see
       https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/2003); until this is fixed,
       use `devtools::run_examples(run = FALSE)`.

    1. Run tests as if not on CRAN in an interactive R session.
       ```{r}
       # Run in R.app, RStudio, or in an R terminal-session:
       Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
       devtools::test()
       ```
       Notes:
        - Make sure that no test is skipped. Investigate if any is skipped.
        - Investigate if any warning is reported.
        - This combines unit tests, documentation and code-style checks;
          the latter take a substantial amount of time to complete.
       The environmental variable `RSOILWAT_ALLTESTS` determines whether or not
       long-running expectations/unit-tests are skipped; the default is "true",
       i.e., run all expectations/unit-tests. You may decide to run tests
       while temporary skipping time-intensive tests, e.g.,
       - `Sys.setenv(RSOILWAT_ALLTESTS = "false"); devtools::test()`
       - `RSOILWAT_ALLTESTS="false" R CMD check *tar.gz`

    1. Run tests as if not on CRAN in an non-interactive session.
       ```{bash}
       # Run via shell in the terminal:
       R CMD INSTALL .
       Rscript -e 'Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true"); devtools::test()'
       ```

    1. The environmental variable `RSOILWAT_INTEGRATIONTESTS` determines
       whether intensive (and potentially interactive) integration tests are
       executed; the default is "false".
       To set it to true, e.g.,
         * `Sys.setenv(RSOILWAT_INTEGRATIONTESTS = "true"); devtools::test()`
         * `RSOILWAT_INTEGRATIONTESTS="true" R CMD check *tar.gz`


    1. Run R package-level checks as if on CRAN.
       ```{r}
       # Run in R.app, RStudio, or in an R terminal-session:
       Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "false")
       devtools::check(cran = TRUE)
       ```
       Notes:
        - Avoid adding new `R CMD check` warnings and/or notes; see, milestone
          [Clean code](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2/milestone/2)




__Debugging compiled code__
  * Compile C code in `src/` and `src/SOILWAT2/` in 'debugging' mode.
    This will define `SWDEBUG` in `SOILWAT2` source code
    (see [SOILWAT2's README](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2)):
    * Install package on the command line:
      ```
      MAKEFLAGS="PKG_DEBUG=-DRSWDEBUG" R CMD INSTALL --preclean --clean .
      ```
    * Using R package `devtools` (e.g., while running R interactively):
      ```{r}
      Sys.setenv(PKG_DEBUG="-DRSWDEBUG")
      devtools::clean_dll() # if you debug in `src/SOILWAT2`
      devtools::load_all(compile = TRUE)
      ```
  * For a more formal approach using `gdb`/`lldb`, please see the
    [section 'Debugging-compiled-code' in the 'R-exts' manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Debugging-compiled-code)

__How to update the submodule 'SOILWAT2'__ to the latest commit
```
git submodule update --remote #--remote: uses the latest commit; without --remote: uses the previously defined commit
git commit -am "Pulled down latest commit 'COMMIT-FLAG' for submodule SOILWAT2"
git push
```

Change branch of submodule `SOILWAT2`
```
nano .gitmodules # and change branch = <branch> to the desired <branch>

git submodule init
git submodule update --remote #--remote: uses the latest commit; without --remote: uses the previously defined commit
git commit -am "Changed to branch 'branch' commit 'COMMIT-FLAG' for submodule SOILWAT2"
git push
```

Run the script `./data-raw/prepare_testInput_objects.R` from within `rSOILWAT2/`
if the `SOILWAT2` updated included changes to the input files.


### Version numbers

We attempt to follow guidelines of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
with version numbers of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

When the version numbers changes, then the package `DESCRIPTION` file
must be adjusted as well
(i.e., update 'Version' in the last commit before PR into master
which will be the new release/version).

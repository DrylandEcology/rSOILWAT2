0			# reset (1/0): reset/don't reset swc each new year
1			# deepdrain (1/0): allow/disallow deep drainage function.
			#   if deepdrain == 1, model expects extra layer in soils file.

# These control the tangent function (tanfunc) which affects the amount of soil
# water extractable by evaporation and transpiration.
# These constants aren't documented by the ELM doc.
15.0			# rate shift (x value of inflection point).  lower value shifts curve 
			# leftward, meaning less water lost to evap at a given swp.  effectively
			# shortens/extends high rate.
0.06			# rate slope: lower value (eg .01) straightens S shape meaning more gradual
			# reduction effect; higher value (.5) makes abrupt transition
0.5			# inflection point (y-value of inflection point)
1.1			# range: diff btw upper and lower rates at the limits

# Notes
* This vignette explains how rSFSW2 has implemented the calculations of soil 
  moisture regime (SMR) and soil temperature regime (STR) and compares the 
  logic with the Java Newhall Simulation Model and with the Keys to Soil 
  Taxonomy (SSS 2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^.
* Quoted text is directly from SSS (2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^. So direction of 
  a logic may be opposite of a condition, which will be indicated by \! before 
  the condition.
* jNSM calculations can be found at end of this document. Line numbers refer 
  to file 'BASICSimulationModel.java' (jNSM 2016^[\ref{def:jNSM2016}]^).



# Definitions of conditions
Our interpretations from SSS (2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^ -- language refers to 
layers, not parts

* __Dry__ := soil water potential < -1.5 MPa "the moisture tension is 1500 
  kPa or more" (p. 29, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* __Moist/wet__ := soil water potential >= -1.5 MPa "water is held at a tension
  of less than 1500 kPa but more than zero" 
  (p. 29, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* __Saturated__ := soil water potential >= -0.033 MPa

* \label{def:histic_epipedon} __Histic epipedon__ := a horizon that is 
  periodically saturated with water and that has sufficiently high amounts of 
  organic carbon (O.C. 12 to 18%, by weight, depending on clay content) to be 
  considered organic soil material. Typically, it is at (or near) the surface 
  and is peat or muck at least 20 cm thick." 
  (p.3-10, SSS 2015^[\ref{def:SSS2015}]^)
* \label{def:Ohorizon} __O-horizon__ := "Horizons [...] dominated by 
  organic soil materials. [...] Some O horizons [...] consist of slightly 
  decomposed to highly decomposed litter, such as leaves, needles, twigs, 
  moss, and lichens, that has been deposited on the surface of either mineral 
  or organic soils." (p. 335, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* \label{def:OSM} __Organic soil material (OSM)__ := "Soil material that  
  contains more than the amounts of organic carbon described above for mineral  
  soil material is considered organic soil material" 
  (p. 3, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* \label{def:MSM} __Mineral soil material (MSM)__ := "(less than 2.0 mm in 
  diameter) _either_:
    1) Is saturated with water for less than 30 days (cumulative) per year in 
       normal years and contains less than 20 percent (by weight) organic 
       carbon; _or_
    2) Is saturated with water for 30 days or more (cumulative) in normal years 
       (or is artificially drained) and, excluding live roots, has an organic 
       carbon content (by weight) of:
        * Less than 18 percent if the mineral fraction contains 60 percent or 
          more clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 percent if the mineral fraction contains no clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.1) percent if the 
          mineral fraction contains less than 60 percent clay." 
          (p. 3, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)

* Remarks
    * Somewhat unclear if PET or AET should be compared with PPT. 
      "evapotranspiration by plants" sounds like AET, but jNSM uses PET. 
      rSFSW2 follows jNSM and uses PET.

# Soil Temperature Regimes
We currently ignore the 'iso-' prefix, i.e., "the mean summer and mean winter 
soil temperatures differ by less than 6 oC at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, 
lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower", which is applicable to 
[frigid](#Frigid), [mesic](#Mesic), [thermic](#Thermic), and 
[hyperthermic](#Hyperthermic) regimes (SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)

## Permafrost
* Permanently frozen layers

  interstitial water, may be dry." (SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)

* Generalized Characteristics (SSS 2015^[\ref{def:SSS2015}]^)
    * p. 3-101: "Layer has temperature of < 0 C for 2 or more consecutive 
      years."


## Gelic
* "Gelic materials are mineral (MSM^[\ref{def:MSM}]^) or organic soil materials 
  (OSM^[\ref{def:OSM}]^) that show evidence of cryoturbation (frost churning) 
  and/or ice segregation in the active layer (seasonal thaw layer) and/or the 
  upper part of the permafrost" (SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)

  continental U.S. but occurs in the soils of Alaska."

  summer.

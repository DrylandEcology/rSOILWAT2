\arguments{
\item{dbWeatherDataFile}{A character string. The path to the weather database
file.}

\item{fbackup}{A character string. The path to where the weather database
should be backed up. If \code{NULL}, then '_copy' is appended to
\code{dbWeatherDataFile}.}

\item{check_all}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then every record is
checked; otherwise, only the first record is checked for the package
version.}

\item{with_resume}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then digest of call and
progress status are stored in a temporary file on disk on the same path as
\code{dbWeatherDataFile}. If such a temporary file is present, then upgrade
is resumed from where progress status indicates. Otherwise, ignore
temporary disk files and attempt to upgrade database records from scratch.}

\item{clean_cache}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then temporary file
generated with \code{with_resume} set to \code{TRUE}, if present, is
removed once upgrade completed successfully.}

\item{type_new}{The type of compression used to compress the weather blobs.
See \code{\link[base]{memCompress}}.}

\item{SWRunInformation}{A data frame.}
